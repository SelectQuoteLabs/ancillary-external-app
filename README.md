## Getting Started

This template repo should be used for external ancillary applications.

An external ancillary app is any application that is exposed to the public internet and is NOT a CRM or Quote Tool.

The Vercel CLI is very useful and should be utilized:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Login to vercel to use the CLI:

```bash
vercel
```

Enter your email used for Vercel. You'll receive an email asking you to verify your account.

Switch to the SQ Team in the CLI:

```

#### Local Tooling

Install local tooling such as `husky` and `lint-staged`:

```bash

```

#### Local OAuth

```
NEXTAUTH_URL='http://localhost:3000'
```
